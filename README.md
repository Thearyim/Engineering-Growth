# Engineering-Growth
When I was of college age, I had just arrived in this country as an immigrant, and was struggling to adapt to the sudden cultural change. I didn't have a chance to go to college because I couldn't afford it and I had a daughter to support. So, I didn't get experience with traditional computer science classes such as algorithms and data structures. I know that this presents a challenge when I am being considered as a candidate for a software engineering position where many of my colleagues have computer science degrees. Whereas I have quite a bit of experience with project-based learning, I need practice to build my skills around algorithms and data structures. So the work that you will see in this repo is my commitment to practice a little bit each week to better prepare myself for a career as software engineer.
