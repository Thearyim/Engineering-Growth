# Engineering-Growth
When I was of college age, I had just arrived in this country as an immigrant, and was struggling to adapt to the sudden cultural change. I didn't have a chance to go to college because I couldn't afford it and I had a daughter to support. So, I didn't get experience with traditional computer science classes such as algorithms and data structures. I know that this presents a challenge when I am being considered as a candidate for a software engineering position where many of my colleagues have computer science degrees. Whereas I have quite a bit of experience with project-based learning, I need practice to build my skills around algorithms and data structures. So the work that you will see in this repo is my commitment to practice a little bit each week to better prepare myself for a career as a software engineer.

* LeetCode  


    LeetCode really helps me get experience with arrays, dictionaries and other common data structures. I am learning a lot about conditionals, looping construct and exit conditions. I am also learning that you can't assume much of anything with the inputs given to you in a function. I have to check them to account for special cases. Efficiency and memory management matter, so I am being cognizant of writing unnecessary code. I've also found that you can run a heap out of memory just the same.

    Big O, algorithms efficiency

Commit instructions-Notes to self:
* Make note of the intuition and approach of how to solved the problem
